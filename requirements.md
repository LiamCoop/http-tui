# Terminal-based HTTP Client Requirements Specification

## Project Overview
A terminal user interface (TUI) HTTP client built in Go, designed primarily for personal use with the possibility of wider distribution. The application will provide a feature-rich, keyboard-driven interface for making and analyzing HTTP requests.

## Core Functionality

### HTTP Methods Support
The application shall support all standard HTTP methods:
- GET
- POST
- PUT
- DELETE
- PATCH
- HEAD
- OPTIONS
- TRACE
- CONNECT

### Request Customization

#### Headers
- Support for adding, editing, and removing custom HTTP headers
- Common headers should be easily accessible or suggested
- Support for saving commonly used headers

#### Request Bodies
- Support for the following body types:
  - JSON (with validation and formatting)
  - Form data (application/x-www-form-urlencoded)
  - Multipart/form-data (for file uploads)
  - No body (for methods like GET, HEAD)

- Intentionally omitted body types (planned for future releases):
  - XML
  - Plain text
  - SPARQL

#### URL Parameters
- Support for path parameters
- Support for query parameters with easy editing
- Parameter validation

#### Authentication
- Basic Authentication (username/password)
- No Authentication
- Support for custom headers to enable Bearer token authentication

### Response Handling
- Pretty-printed JSON with syntax highlighting
- Collapsible/expandable response body for large responses
- Response headers displayed in a separate, initially collapsed view
- Color-coded status codes for easy identification
- Response time and size metrics

### User Interface Features
- Split view panels for request and response
- Tabbed interface for working with multiple requests
- Request history with ability to reload and edit past requests
- Environment variables for reusable values across requests
- Configuration profiles saved to disk
- Vim-like keybindings for navigation by default
- User-configurable keybindings via config file

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Handle large requests and responses efficiently
- Optimize UI rendering for terminal environments
- Provide performance metrics for requests (timing, size)

### Usability
- Clear error handling with meaningful feedback
- Intuitive keyboard shortcuts with onscreen help
- Minimal learning curve for users familiar with other HTTP clients
- Consistent UI patterns

### Configuration
- Support for a configuration file (YAML/JSON/TOML)
- Customizable keybindings
- Configurable default settings
- Ability to save and load workspace state

## Future Features (Not in MVP)
- Export requests to curl commands
- Scriptability for request sequences
- Proxy configuration
- Additional security features (certificate validation options)
- Additional body types (XML, TEXT, SPARQL)
- OAuth and other authentication methods

## Technical Constraints
- Written in Go
- TUI library to be determined based on project needs
- HTTP client library to be determined based on project needs
- Preference for standard library where appropriate

## Development Priorities
1. Core HTTP functionality (methods, basic request/response)
2. TUI implementation with vim-like navigation
3. Request customization features
4. Response handling and formatting
5. Configuration and persistence
6. Performance optimization

## Success Criteria
- Successfully executes all supported HTTP methods
- Properly displays formatted responses with syntax highlighting
- Saves and retrieves request history
- Supports environment variables
- Provides an intuitive, keyboard-driven user experience
- Handles errors gracefully with clear user feedback
